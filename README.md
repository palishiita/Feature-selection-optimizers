# Feature-Selection-Optimizers
## Investigating optimization algorithms for efficient feature selection in machine learning models.
### This project focuses on comparing nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms—specifically those that mimic the social behaviors of animals versus those that simulate human intelligence and learning processes.

Selected Optimizers:
- Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) – inspired by the leadership and hunting behavior of grey wolves.
- Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) – inspired by the educational interaction between teachers and learners.
